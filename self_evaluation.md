# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
    - So far I am feeling pretty confident with arrays. The shift and unshift methods confused me for a bit, but taking a break and coming abck to them helped big time. Crazy how stepping away can make such a big change. 
2. Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
    - I think familiarity is needed. I am thinking that the nest lesson will build on these concepts and help reinforce the learning I've done here todya.
3. What questions do you have about Arrays?
    - No questions specifically about arrays. I think learning how to read and interpret the methodology notes from ruby docs is something that I nedd to practice. As I said, shift unshift weren't making complete sense. Had to practice and work through a few things.
